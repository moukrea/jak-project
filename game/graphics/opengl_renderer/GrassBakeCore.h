// qualify. Placement already samples the ACTUAL per-triangle surface (barycentric
// on the real tri plane, gi.py below), so this is NOT a flat/min-Y reference; the
// old 0.7 gate simply REJECTED the non-flat tris of bumpy platforms, leaving grass
// only on their flattest (often lowest) tris -> looked like grass sunk under the
// surface / whole platforms skipped.
// OWNER POLISH#5: 0.40 admitted faces up to ~66° -> steep rock lips still got blades
// ("brins dans les parties verticales"). Tightened to 0.50 (rejects faces steeper than
// 60° from horizontal) as the SECONDARY safety net behind the texture filter — bumpy
// grass platforms (<~45°) still qualify, but steep/vertical rock faces do not. Kept as
// abs(ny) (winding-agnostic): a vertical wall has abs(ny)/nlen ~= 0, so it is rejected.
// OWNER POLISH#8: grass/cards "n'arrivent pas au bords des plateformes" — a bald flat-texture
// margin at platform EDGES. The edge LIP tris of a grass-textured platform are grass-textured
// (tra-grass, the STRICT primary filter) but slope down steeper than 60°, so upness 0.50 rejected
// them and left the border bare. Since the texture filter is now strict exact-match (rock is a
// DIFFERENT texture, tra-beachrock — excluded regardless of slope), the upness net can be relaxed
// to catch these grass-textured edge lips: 0.50 -> 0.35 (rejects only faces steeper than ~69.5°, so
// near-vertical walls are still out). Grass now reaches the actual grass-textured platform edges.

// — it is blade BASES placed on the steep grass-textured EDGE-LIP triangles POLISH#8 admitted when it
// relaxed the upness net to 0.35. Those lips face OUTWARD/DOWNWARD over the drop, so a base ON the lip
// hangs past the visible platform silhouette (= "l'herbe qui dépasse, flottante"), and the shader rim-
// clamp cannot help because it only limits offset FROM the base. FIX (PHASE 1.5 below): keep the lip
// tris in the KEPT set for texture/coverage accounting, but do NOT place BASES on a tri that is (a)
// tilted (upness < UPNESS_LIP_MAX) AND (b) an OVERHANG — its lowest/downhill edge opens into void (used
// by no OTHER grass triangle). Continuous gentle slopes (downhill edge shared with more grass) still get
// grass, so the POLISH#3 sloped-platform coverage does NOT regress. Excluding the lip makes the shoulder
// edge (flat-top<->lip) a TRUE RIM again, so the flat top's near-shoulder blades are spread-clamped to it

// lies within OCC_RADIUS of ITS OWN (px,pz) AND in the near-ground contact band [+OCC_LO,+OCC_HI]
// above ITS OWN ground Y. On an open platform (no object vertex within the radius+band) occ_culled ~0

// ROUND#13: tightened the contact band 1.5m -> 1.0m so only object geometry that actually comes DOWN
// near the grass surface hides it; overhead TIE structure (>1m up) no longer culls the grass below it
// (that was a source of the stray block holes). POLISH#7 kept only the visible above-ground footprint.
